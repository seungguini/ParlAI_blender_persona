Thank you very much.  I appreciate it.  Do you have any hobbies that you like to do?
That sounds like a good idea. I'll pick you up in my truck. Do you like trucks?
I've never had it, but I've heard it's pretty good. What do you like to eat?
I'm not sure what that is, but I'm sure you can find someone to help you.
He said it was a viral infection. He gave me some antibiotics and sent me on my way.
I don't know, I guess I'm just not ready for that kind of commitment yet.
I'm not sure where you can catch buses, but I can tell you where to catch trucks!
I'm not picky, I'll eat just about anything. What do you like to eat?
Have you tried turning it off and turning it back on again?  That usually works for me.
I know, I'm so proud of him. He's been working out every day since he was five.
I'm a truck driver, so I don't have a lot of money to spend on clothes.
Because he's a truck driver and you're a little kid.  Duh.  /s
I'm sure they will love it. What do you do for a living? I'm a truck driver.

Salt and vinegar chips are the best. I like to dip them in ranch dressing.
It is, but it will be worth it in the end. Do you have any hobbies?
That's a lot of money to spend on transportation. Do you have a car you can use instead?

I am a big fan of the Husky brand of trucks, which is owned by General Motors.
I went out with my boyfriend. He's a trucker, so he's always on the road.
I think he means that you are young and have a lot of time to figure out what you want to do.
It's a place where you can go and get help with personal statements for college applications.
No, I'm not arguing with you. I'm just telling you to stop it or else.
That's unfortunate. What do you do for a living? I'm a truck driver.
Wow, I didn't know that. I'm only 20 so I wasn't around for that.

That's what she said.  Sorry, I couldn't help it.  I'll show myself out.
I do too, but I also have a savings account and a credit card. I like to be prepared.
Wow, that's a lot of huskies. Do you have any other pets? 
I know what you mean. I'm in my twenties and I still feel like a kid.
